# Zvim's Neovim Configuration

This is my neovim configuration. It is a fork from [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)'s neovim configuration.
I have made some changes to it to suit my needs.

## Prerequisites:
- install neovim
- install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
- install nodejs (for Copilot plugin)

# Installation

Clone this repo where you want
Once you have cloned the repo, you need to run the `init.sh`:

```bash
bash init.sh
```
